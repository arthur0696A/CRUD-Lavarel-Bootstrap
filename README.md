Title: Flexy Challenge
Description: This project consisted of a CRUD system (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of products.

The following technologies were used:

Laravel Framework 5.3
Atom text editor
Windows 10 Operating System
PHP 7.4.9
MySQL Database 5.7.31
WampServer

Installation guide:
- The first step was to install composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- After that the wampserver was installed (https://www.wampserver.com/#download-wrapper).
- And finally, download Laravel (composer create-project laravel/laravel www
                                 cd example-app
                                 php artisan serve)
- I didn't need to define any environment variable in the operating system because it was already set.

To run the program you need:
- Run WampServer;
- Run the server (php artisan serve);
- Enter localhost:8000/products;
